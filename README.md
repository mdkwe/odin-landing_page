# The Odin Project : Project 02 - a landing page : "Momentum - A Productivity Blog"

Welcome to the Momentum repository! This project is part of my "Full Stack Developper Ruby on Rails" training course. The goal of this project is to create a single page website for a blog about productivity, called Momentum.

The website will consist of a header, a section for articles about the topic, an inspiration quote, and a footer. The design provided is quite neutral, so I decided to apply it to this fictitious project.


Screenshot of the project :

This project will help me to put into practice all the HTML and CSS (with Flexbox) knowledge I've acquired.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear your feedback!

Thanks for visiting!
